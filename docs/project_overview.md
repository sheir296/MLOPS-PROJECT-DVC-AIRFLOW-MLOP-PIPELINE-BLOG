# Project Overview: Weather Prediction App

## Objective
Develop an end-to-end weather prediction application utilizing MLOps best practices.

## Architecture
1. **Frontend**:
   - Built using React.js.
   - User inputs city and temperature for predictions.
   - Interacts with the backend via API.

2. **Backend**:
   - Developed with FastAPI.
   - Predicts weather conditions based on trained models.
   - Features include CI/CD integration and scalable deployments.

3. **Machine Learning**:
   - Dataset: Weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed).
   - Model: Random Forest Regressor (scikit-learn).
   - Version control: MLFlow for model tracking, DVC for data versioning.

4. **MLOps Pipeline**:
   - Airflow DAGs for automating data preprocessing and model training.
   - Kubernetes for deployment scalability.
   - GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.

## Features
- **Real-time weather predictions**.
- **Data versioning and model tracking**.
- **Automated deployments via CI/CD**.

## Future Scope
- Integrate additional weather parameters (e.g., precipitation, wind direction).
- Implement deep learning models for enhanced predictions.
- Scale deployments to handle larger datasets and users.
