# Blog: Building a Weather Prediction App with MLOps

## Introduction
Weather prediction is a complex task that requires accurate data and robust machine learning models. In this project, we developed a weather prediction application using an MLOps pipeline to ensure seamless integration of machine learning with modern software practices.

## Key Features
- Real-time predictions based on city and temperature inputs.
- Robust backend API built with FastAPI.
- Frontend UI for easy interaction.
- Integrated CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Comprehensive version control for data and models using DVC.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Model Training**: Python (scikit-learn)
- **MLOps**: Airflow, MLFlow, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Challenges
- Ensuring data consistency across the pipeline.
- Integrating MLFlow with Kubernetes for scalable deployment.
- Creating user-friendly frontend interfaces for non-technical users.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how MLOps can streamline machine learning workflows and improve production readiness. Stay tuned for more updates!
